- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenjaminGordonCody. I'm a junior programmer and data-scientist looking for entry-level roles in the Manchester area. As well as the languages I can write in (Python, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, LUA) I also bring a background in creative-writing and graphic design from my previous work as an artist and author.

- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a communicative medium! I get realy excited for clean, elegant code. I'm also very interested in using my data science toolset to reveal new stories from complicated datasets.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying an MSc in Computer Science with Big Data Analytics. I'm also undertaking short courses in data visualisation and communication.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with translating complicated data into compelling, accessible stories. I'm also interested in any projects concerning human-rights, data-journalism, or making music.

- 📫 The best places to reach me are here, LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgcody/), or via email (g.gordoncody@gmail.com)
